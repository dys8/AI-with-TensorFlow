Collaborative Filtering code is based on RBM. The data is acquired from GroupLens.org.
This dataset (ml-latest) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 27753444 ratings and 1108997 tag applications across 58098 movies. 

Language Processing code is based on LSTM. We use the Penn Treebank dataset which has over 4,800,000 annotated words in it. 
Our goal is to predict what the next words would be rather than what they mean in context. We measure the accuracy of the method by looking at the perplexity level.
