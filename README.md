Collaborative Filtering code is based on RBM.

Language Processing code is based on LSTM. We use the Penn Treebank dataset which has over 4,800,000 annotated words in it. 
Our goal is to predict what the next words would be rather than what they mean in context. We measure the accuracy of the method by looking at the perplexity level.
